#Scheduler NodeJS example

This is an example setup of Ext Scheduler with an Express Node JS backend. The communication between client and server
is handled by WebSockets using the socket.io library. Simple arrays on server side serve as a Database, so changes disappear after restarting the server.

#Requirements

This example requires NodeJS v0.6+ to run. Node should be added to the path and should be accessible from the console/command line.

#Running

To run the example, go to the node_example folder in your console/command line and type `node node_backend.js`.
